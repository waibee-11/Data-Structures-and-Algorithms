Logic:
- Traverse through the entire array
- If element found, then return 1
- If you reach the end of the loop (element not found), return -1

Pseudo-code:
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
  if (arr[i] == to_find){
    return 1;
  }
}
return -1;

TC: O(n) as we are travesing through the array once (in the worst case).
