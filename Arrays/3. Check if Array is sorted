Logic: Traverse through every element in the array and see if it is smaller than the next element. If not, then return false. Or else, at the end return true.

Pseudo-code:
for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
  if (arr[i] > arr[i+1]){
    return False;
  }
}
return True;

TC: O(n) since we are traversing through the array only once.

Notes:
- in the for loop, we are looping only till i < n - 1 to avoid index_out_of_range error than can occur while comparing arr[n-1] with arr[n] if we are not careful
