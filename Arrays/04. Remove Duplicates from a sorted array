Logic: Set i = 0. Traverse through the entire array once. Move forward until you reach the first element that is not equal to arr[i] and bring it to arr[i+1] and move i forward by 1 step. Keep doing this until you get to the end of the array.

Pseudo-code:
int i = 0;
for (int j = 1; j < n; j++){
  if (arr[j] != arr[i]){
    arr[i+1] = arr[j];
    i++;
  }
}

TC: O(n) since we are traversing through the array only once.

Notes:
- the for loop starts with j = 1 since we need not compare the 0th element. It will always be unique since it is the first element in the array.
