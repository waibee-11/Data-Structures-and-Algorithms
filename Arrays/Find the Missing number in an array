There are 4 possible approaches. Currently I have knowledge of only the 1st approach. Will update the remaining methods later.

Approach 1: Use Hashing

Logic:
- Create an array hasher with indexes 0,1,....,n
- For every element in arr, hasher[arr[i]] += 1
- Then iterate through hasher from index 1 to n
- Return the index for which hasher[i] = 0

Pseudo-code:
int hasher[n+1];
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
  hasher[arr[i]] += 1;
}

for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++){
  if (hasher[i] == 0){
    return i;
  }
}

TC: O(2n) since we first iterate through arr and then iterate through hasher
