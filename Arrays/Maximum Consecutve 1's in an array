Logic:
- Set max_ct = 0 and ct = 0
- Iterate through every element of the array
- If the element is 1, then ct += 1
- If the element is 0, then check if ct is greater than max_ct. If so, then update max_ct to ct and make ct = 0
- After ending the loop, once again check if ct is bigger than max_ct to include the case of consecutive 1's ending the array.

Pseudo-code:
int max_ct = 0;
int ct = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
  if (arr[i] == 1){
    ct++;
  } else {
    if (ct > max_ct){
      max_ct = ct;
    }
    ct = 0;
  }
}
if (ct > max_ct){
  ct_max = ct;
}
return max_ct;

TC: O(n) since we are traversing through the array only once.

Notes:
- Remember to have the additional check after the for loop.
