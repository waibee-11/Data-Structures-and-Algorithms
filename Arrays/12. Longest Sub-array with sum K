Only Brute Force is done. Have to update remaining approaches.

Approach 1: Brute Force

Logic:
- set max_len and len to 0
- iterate through the aray
- at every step, make a loop from that index till the end
- keep track of the sum of numbers from that index till the end. Also keep track of the number of numbers (len)
- if the sum equals k, then update max_len if the len of that subarray exceeds max_len

Pseudo-code:
int len = 0;
int max_len = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
  int sum = 0;
  for (int j = i; j < n; j++){
    sum += arr[j];
    len += 1;
    if (sum == k && len > max_len){
      max_len = len;
    }
  }
}
return max_len;

TC: O(n^2) since we have a nested for loop inside another for loop [This code will exceed time-limit]
